GitHub: [https://github\.com/JorisZierold](https://github.com/JorisZierold)

Joris will handle all aspects of development including:

- Smart Contract Development: Design and implementation of Midnight Compact contracts for credential storage, proof generation, and verification
- zkTLS Integration: Integration of TLSNotary protocol with Midnight blockchain, transcript data parsing, and attestation verification
- Frontend Development: Building student and employer user interfaces with Lace wallet integration
- Documentation &amp; Testing: Comprehensive README, tutorials, code documentation, and test suite development

Relevant Experience: Currently working with zero-knowledge proof systems and TLSNotary (tlsnotary.org), providing direct hands-on experience with the core technologies required for this project. This existing expertise in both zkTLS and ZK proofs significantly de-risks the technical implementation.



As a solo developer, Joris will maintain full accountability for all deliverables and milestone completions, with transparent progress tracking through public GitHub commits and monthly demonstration videos.Retry"

- **GitHub:** [https://github\.com/Emmanuel\-Tyty](https://github.com/Emmanuel-Tyty)

I am the lead developer behind **[1694\.io](%5Bhttps://gitlab.2lovelaces.io/voltaire/www.1694.io)** one of Cardano’s main DRep campaign platforms (1,000+ active users), responsible for both backend governance data flows and frontend DRep profiles. I’ve also contributed to **GovTool** ([proposal outcomes section](%5Bhttps://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool-outcomes-pillar)) working directly with governance data models and UX for non‑technical users.

Currently I’m building the new **[Cardano Ambassadors Tools](%5Bhttps://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ambassador-tool),** designing contributor‑facing UX and integrating multiple community data sources. In addition, I serve as a **Developer Advocate at Intersect**, where I help onboard developers into Cardano governance, run workshops, and translate protocol design into developer‑friendly patterns. This mix—1694.io, GovTool, the Ambassadors site, and dev advocacy—means I already work at the intersection of governance, UX, and education.

- Focus: interaction design, component UX, and design systems.
- Responsible for:
    - turning privacy concepts (“prove delegation without doxxing”) into clear checkboxes, badges, and flows,
    - designing Lace connect + review/whistleblower screens that are easy for everyday delegators,
    - producing a small, reusable design system that other governance UIs can copy.

**Developer Apprentices – Structured Onboarding**

As part of this project, I will bring in a small batch of **developer apprentices** (junior devs or new to Cardano) and give them structured, hands‑on experience with governance tooling and Midnight:

- I regularly onboard developers to Cardano through my work as a Developer Advocate at Intersect (code walkthroughs, example repos, office hours). This project will use the same approach:
    - pair programming on small, well‑scoped tasks,
    - mandatory code review by me on all governance / Compact changes,
    - short design docs for each module so apprentices understand _why_ as well as _how_.
- During this project, apprentices will get practical experience in:
    - wiring React components to wallet APIs and governance backends,
    - writing and testing small pieces of integration logic,
    - contributing documentation and examples that other teams can follow.

I will remain responsible for the overall architecture, final implementation quality, and all critical Compact/Midnight code. The apprentices’ work is scoped to non‑critical pieces (UI states, helper scripts, tests, docs), giving them real Cardano experience while keeping delivery risk low. All work happens in a public, MIT‑licensed GitHub repo, so Catalyst can see both my contributions and how new developers are being grown into the ecosystem."

The Merito Compact DApp project will be executed by a focused, two-person team with specialized expertise in blockchain governance architecture, systems design, and software engineering. We have the required internal capacity for the entire scope of the 3-month project and do not require additional recruitment.

# Core Team Members
- **Omid Ajorlou** (Crypto_Oaj)
    - **Role**: Software Architect &amp; Project Lead
    - Responsible for overall architectural design, governance logic formulation, and compliance with the Midnight framework. Specific deliverables include: Compact Contract design (MeritoWeightingEngine.compact), defining the ZK circuit logic, and leading technical documentation.

# Statement on Team Capacity and Commitment
- **Current Projects Disclosure:** Both team members are currently collaborating on GovCircle, a decentralized governance solution based on CIP-1694. This ongoing work directly informs the architectural decisions and problem-solving approach of Merito, creating significant synergy and reducing the learning curve. The proposed scope for Merito (a 3-month focused PoC) has been carefully sized to ensure it does not conflict with the existing development schedule and can be delivered on time.
- **Capacity and Consent:** Both Omid Ajourlou and Sadegh Ghoroghi have confirmed their dedicated capacity and commitment to deliver the milestones outlined in this proposal. Consent for the public disclosure of their names, roles, and profiles has been obtained.
- **No Recruitment Required:** The project scope is tightly defined to utilize the combined skills of a Software Architect (governance design, Compact logic) and a Software Engineer (TypeScript/SDK implementation). No external recruitment is needed, ensuring project delivery remains predictable and contained within the $USDM 9,000 budget and 3-month timeline.

**External Engagement and Support**

As this is a code-first Reference DApp focused on core protocol demonstration, we are not reliant on formal third-party collaborations for development. However, we have taken steps to ensure we can access necessary technical support:

- **Midnight Foundation Channels:** We have established contact with the relevant developer channels and community forums to solicit early feedback on the ZK circuit design and Compact language implementation, confirming the availability of technical support for specific queries related to the Private State architecture. This ensures that expert resources will be available if technical challenges arise during the build phase."

**_Collaborators_**

Dr. Navjit (IAGON) 

 Decentralized Storage – Advises on off-chain storage of encrypted user documents. Supports integration with IAGON infrastructure where blockchain storage is insufficient. 



We have started to collaborate with Iagon, who are pioneering a decentralized marketplace for storage and computing resources. Their platform aims to simplify and democratize access to the shared storage economy, making it accessible to everyone. Initially, the focus is on creating a transparent storage marketplace, enabling providers to trade their surplus storage with consumers at fair prices, while ensuring data privacy and security. Through file encryption, encoding, and a unique sharding algorithm, Iagon can store files with any desired degree of redundancy and security, making it suitable for sensitive legal documents like wills.





**_Geography Focus_**

The initial PoC targets Cape Town, South Africa, with potential for later expansion to Gaza, India and similar regions with limited access to affordable legal services.





**_Commitment & Capacity_**

All core team members have confirmed availability and are actively engaged. Collaboration with IAGON is secured to ensure storage feasibility for encrypted legal documents. We are prepared to direct a portion of the funds toward running IAGON nodes in jurisdictions that require in-region storage for wills, ensuring compliance where IAGON infra is not yet available."

Design off-chain workflows for auditors or counterparties to access encrypted CoT data under predefined terms; ensure privacy best practices are met.

**SDK & Developer Tools Engineer – \(Eldana Getachew\)**

Building TypeScript and Plutus SDKs, developer-friendly APIs, and integration tools is the responsibility of this engineer. The dApp developer should find it easy to access ReasonChain oracle outputs to verify proofs and interact with CoT commitments. This individual will proceed to produce exemplar apps, tutorials, and integration guides to provide means for accelerating the adoption on the Cardano side. CI/CD pipelines for testing and publishing SDK updates will also be maintained.

**DevOps & Security Engineer \- \(Eldana Getachew\)**

For deploying, monitoring, and securing ReasonChain infrastructure, including off-chain oracle nodes, proof servers, and integration with Hydra channels, this position is responsible. Reproducible builds, automated test suites, and security audits must be implemented by the incumbent. Performance benchmarking, uptime maintenance of oracle feeds, and ensuring the resilience of all nodes to attacks or downtimes are their responsibilities. They also organize external audits for smart contracts and zkML circuits.

**Ecosystem & Community Liaison \- \(Eldana Getachew\)**

The Ecosystem Liaison is an interface for community engagement, outreach, and developer adoption. They establish communication lines with pilot dApps, coordinate workshops, and work on educational material in English and regional languages like Amharic and Afan Oromo. Feedback from developers and partners should be incorporated into the project while on the other hand, the position facilitates new users in onboarding onto ReasonChain. Marketing is also supported in organizing AMA sessions, blog writing, and social media updates to boost visibility.

**Research Advisor – \(Edilawit Getachew\)**

The Research Advisor is tasked with overseeing zkML, chain-of-thought processes, and AI verifiability. The said person aims to ensure systems comply with academic best practices and cutting-edge research, while reviewing design decisions and validating approaches about correctness of proofs and integrity. They also interpret results and make security trade-offs while liaising into broader research communities of ZK and AI.

**Optional Partners/Pilot Integrators**

ReasonChain may partner with select dApps in the DeFi, governance, or RWA spaces for a pilot integration. These partners will be trying out the oracle outputs; providing feedback on the usability; and confirming the real-world working of the system-at-hand. For instance, these could be Orcfax for market feeds, governance tools for verified AI analysis, and RWA platforms requiring verifiable risk assessments. They are not considered part of the full-time internal team but are crucial for proving feasibility and adoption.

**Team capabilities and Synergy**

The team is structured such that all technical and operational aspects-the cryptography, smart contracts, privacy, developer tooling, infrastructure, research, and community adoption-are covered. The members of the team possess well-defined accountabilities, ensuring the workstreams are as non-overlapping as practically possible while remaining tightly integrated. The use of sprints, version control on GitHub, milestone-based reports, and reviews will hold the team accountable for its deliverables, maintain transparency, and keep track of progress. Weekly stand-up meetings, coupled with milestone reviews, would keep the project on track with Fund 14 timelines.

**Experience and Credibility**

• Combined blockchain-wise experience: 15+ years working on Plutus development, Cardano integrations, and Layer 2 solutions.

• ZK/AI research-wise experience: 10+ peer-reviewed publications and contributions to open-source zk frameworks.

• DevOps & community-wise experience: Deployed many Cardano testnet/mainnet dApps and led educational workshops."

Lyse serves as independent execution supervisor ensuring quality standards are maintained across all workshops and study groups through direct observation and systematic feedback collection. She attends workshops across different universities, rotating presence so each institution experiences oversight multiple times throughout project period. Her supervision role includes evaluating whether facilitators adhere to curriculum, whether hands-on practice receives adequate support, whether students demonstrate genuine comprehension versus superficial compliance, and whether workshop environments feel psychologically safe for asking questions. Lyse conducts real-time feedback sessions with facilitators immediately after workshops, providing constructive observations about what worked well and what needs adjustment before next session. She leads impact assessment by designing interview protocols for qualitative research, conducting structured interviews with thirty diverse participants, analyzing responses for themes and insights, and synthesizing findings into comprehensive narrative that captures how blockchain education affected students' perspectives and plans beyond measurable metrics.

Her proven track record organizing events directly applies to ensuring our workshops meet quality expectations and our impact assessment captures genuine insights rather than superficial satisfaction ratings. Her strong network across Burundian universities, particularly with student leaders and innovation communities, provides additional partnership opportunities and recruitment channels for ambassadors. Lyse manages the sustainability audit by independently verifying which clubs continue Cardano sessions, which study groups maintain meetings, and which ambassadors remain active without project team prompting, providing honest assessment unclouded by team members' optimism about their own program success.

Experience includes narrative and analytical content creation, governance explainers, policy-oriented communication, and translating complex technical concepts for non-technical audiences.



The project lead has participated in Cardano Summits, Builder Fest, governance workshops, and ecosystem-wide initiatives, gaining firsthand exposure to governance discussions, identity frameworks, tooling evolution, community development, and institutional adoption signals. This background provides the necessary understanding of both communication challenges and ecosystem priorities.



All project activities will be delivered independently, ensuring editorial consistency, clear accountability, and a controlled workflow. Engagement with ecosystem contributors or public-sector stakeholders will be used only to enrich contextual understanding and will not modify the project’s delivery structure.



**Roles and Responsibilities**



- Editorial and Narrative Direction: Definition of tone, structure, analytical posture, and accessibility guidelines for all materials, ensuring alignment with ecosystem expectations and institutional clarity.



- Ecosystem Research and Verification: Continuous monitoring of governance updates, CIPs, identity standards, tooling improvements, interoperability initiatives, and ecosystem signals. All information will be validated using official sources and community-reviewed materials.



- Analytical and Narrative Content Production: Development of narrative episodes, analytical articles, policy briefs, micro-interviews, and explanatory visual materials, all grounded in systematic research and transparent documentation.



- Institutional Insight Integration: Inclusion of insights derived from dialogues with public-sector actors, such as ICT secretariats, ensuring relevance to real adoption needs while maintaining a non-consultative, informational approach.



- Community Engagement and Feedback Management: Monitoring interactions, gathering insights from community members, and incorporating relevant feedback into the content strategy to enhance impact and reach.



- Project Management and Accountability: Timeline coordination, milestone tracking, quality assurance, version management, and systematic publication of all deliverables in an open CC-BY repository. Ensures transparency, traceability, and responsible use of resources.



No additional collaborators are required for the initial scope. If future expansion becomes necessary, priority will be given to profiles with expertise in audiovisual production, information design, governance literacy, and public-sector digital transformation. However, all core deliverables can be fully completed by the project lead with the requested budget."

019abebf-b3a1-7d0b-b15d-906ce1f41e7f,Redefining Music Commerce With ADA Branded Gift Cards,60000,Jeffery Lakes,"Although this project is founder-led, it is supported by an emerging ecosystem of artists, creators, retailers, and technical collaborators who enable delivery at scale. The combination of direct founder oversight, existing infrastructure, and pre-built participant networks makes this project both feasible and highly accountable.



1. Jeffery Lakes — Founder, CEO & Project Lead



Role:



Overall project owner



Lead architect of the digital gift card ecosystem



Responsible for execution across milestones, reporting, budgeting, and compliance



Manages artist activations, creator recruitment, and retailer onboarding



Oversees ADA-branded funnel integration, landing page development, and marketing flows



Primary point of contact with Cardano Catalyst Project Managers



Capability Rationale:

Jeffery brings more than a decade of experience selling ATMs, prepaid phone cards, and merchant services to retail stores — all directly aligned with onboarding and incentive programs.

He has produced over a dozen music promotional campaigns using prepaid formats and currently manages 19 signed artists within the Featured Artist Network.

This blend of retail activation, prepaid systems, and music/creator ecosystem management is uniquely suited to deploying ADA incentives at scale.



2. F.A.N. Artist Network (19 Artists Signed, 6 Active, 13 Reactivating)



Role:



Serve as the cultural and distribution backbone of ADA gift card visibility



Promote ADA-branded content across their pages, audiences, and socials



Host dynamic ADA banner ads on their dedicated artist pages



Participate in content campaigns, live promotions, and awareness pushes



Capability Rationale:

This network is already secured and functional.

Artists have existing traffic and fan engagement, which increases the feasibility of Cardano onboarding without needing new user acquisition channels.



3. Modern Beats — Artist Pipeline Partner



Role:



Supplies additional artists to expand ADA reach



Provides creator-ready talent for promotional waves



Enhances scalability beyond the initial 19 artists



Capability Rationale:

This partnership ensures the project is not limited to the current roster and can grow the cultural footprint of ADA across new genres and audiences.



4. Creator Cohort — 300 UGC Creators (Structured, Incentivized)



Role:



Produce 900–1,800 pieces of ADA-themed content



Demonstrate gift card usage, redemption, and learn-and-earn flows



Amplify retail bundles and artist ADA promotions



Drive short-form ADA visibility on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, IG Reels, and Facebook Reels



Capability Rationale:

Creators are recruited into a structured incentive system, not a loose volunteer group.

RewardShare+ plus ADA-branded gift cards creates clear motivation and accountability.

The scale of creator output increases feasibility by decentralizing promotional workload across hundreds of participants.



5. Retail Partner Cohort — 50 E-Commerce Stores



Role:



Bundle ADA-branded gift cards with products



Push ADA promotions to 1,000+ subscribers each



Publish ADA landing page links and banners



Participate in two required promotional pushes



Capability Rationale:

Retailers bring guaranteed distribution channels, solving the exposure problem that usually slows adoption projects.

By requiring 1,000+ subscribers, quality and reach are assured before onboarding.



6. Web Development & Technical Integrators (Contracted as Needed)



Roles:



Implement ADA banner rotation system on artist pages



Support ADA Commerce Hub UI/UX updates



Manage landing page builds and analytics tracking



Assist with RewardShare+ integration updates



Capability Rationale:

While CCR does not maintain a full-time engineering staff, all tech components are modular, low-complexity, and already in production (artist pages, card delivery system, RewardShare+).

Technical needs are incremental — and easily delivered through short-term contracts.



7. Graphic Design & Visual Production (Contracted)



Role:



Produce ADA banner ads



Design gift card imagery



Create marketing assets for artists, creators, and retailers



Develop Catalyst-aligned reporting graphics



Capability Rationale:

Visual components are low-risk, well-scoped, and easily outsourced to trusted designers.

Much of CCR’s brand system is already built.



8. Public Relations & Media Distribution (Contracted as Needed)



Role:



Prepare PR releases for retailer onboarding waves



Distribute ADA-centric announcements



Support content amplification across online media



Capability Rationale:

CCR has previously executed PR campaigns for music releases and gift card launches.

Extending these systems for ADA-related messaging requires no new infrastructure.



9. Analytics & Reporting (Managed by Founder, Automated via Platform)



Role:



Track impressions across creators, artists, retailers, and landing pages



Analyze RewardShare+ registrations and gift card redemption data



Produce milestone reports for Catalyst



Publish final impact summary



Capability Rationale:

CCR’s internal systems already track:



impressions



card registrations



page views



click-throughs



referral flow



This ensures accurate, trustworthy reporting without needing new analytics engineering.



Summary for Reviewers



This project is delivered through a hybrid model:



A strong, experienced founder-led core



A pre-built ecosystem of artists, creators, and retailers



Modular technical work that is low-complexity and easily outsourced



Established systems for distribution, content, retail promotion, and analytics



This structure minimizes risk, maximizes feasibility, and ensures high accountability by distributing execution across existing, active networks."

019ab201-d5c3-7f08-9516-8d26322e52e1,Farmer Rewards Protocol: Proof of Impact Eco-Credits,199500,EDER,"The applicant name **EDER** represents Edward and Eric, working as a dedicated delivery partnership for this project. While not operating under a single legal entity, this collaboration is intentional: it combines deep agricultural expertise with proven blockchain development capability to deliver a focused, high-impact pilot without organisational overhead.

Here the role and track record of each participant:

# **🙋 Eric Duneau, Technololgy Lead**
**[https://www\.linkedin\.com/in/ericduneau/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericduneau/)**

Eric brings more than 25 years of software industry leadership, including experience as CEO/CTO of a ~$30M multinational software business prior to transitioning full-time into blockchain, identity infrastructure, and applied AI. Since selling that business in 2019, his work has focused on Cardano-based decentralised identity and verifiable credential systems.

Eric has successfully delivered five Catalyst-funded projects since Fund 6 — all completed, reported, and verified. Examples include:

- Sign-In With Cardano (Fund 8):  [https://github\.com/incubiq/sign\_in\_with\_wallet](https://github.com/incubiq/sign_in_with_wallet)
- Autonomous AI Identity Framework (Fund 11):  [https://milestones\.projectcatalyst\.io/projects/1100164](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100164)
- Conditional Transfers via VCs (Fund 12): [https://milestones\.projectcatalyst\.io/projects/1200085](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200085)
- Trusted Digital Identity Voting System (Fund 12): [https://milestones\.projectcatalyst\.io/projects/1200194](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200194/)

For this project, Eric has scoped the build to **180 days** within a **12\-month delivery schedule**, incorporating a significant 30% buffer to ensure predictable execution and risk-resilience.

# **🙋 Edward Towers, Agricultural and Impact lead**
**[https://www\.linkedin\.com/in/edward\-towers\-133b32138/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-towers-133b32138/)**

Edward is an active Lancashire dairy farmer who helped pioneer the UK’s first specialty barista milk brand (Brades Farm Barista Milk) and the worlds first carbon credits from reducing enteric methane under an approved methodology (mootral cow credits 2021).

On farm he leads sustainability—200 kW solar, ancient-woodland stewardship, and practical trials to cut emissions—working with the University of Bristol and the UK Dairy Carbon Network.

He was awarded and completed an international research scholarship on farmer incentives, biodiversity improvement, and regenerative economics (Nuffield report published in 2025 ; see  [https://incubiq\.com/\_prod/frp/pdf/ETNFR\_FINAL\.pdf](https://incubiq.com/_prod/frp/pdf/ETNFR_FINAL.pdf).)).

Edward ensures the protocol reflects real farming behaviour, realistic evidence collection, and clear do-no-harm checks—so farmers are incentivised for verified results.

He has experience all the way from the soil to the consumer, in sharing ideas, launching novel products, marketing and public speaking. He will lead domain validation, communication, farmer onboarding, and real-world deployment.

# **✔ Why This Team Works**
Although coming from different professional paths, both team members share agricultural roots and aligned values. The partnership blends:

- Technical execution capacity
- Real-world agricultural context
- Evidence-based methodology
- Stakeholder communication and adoption expertise

# **🔁 Lessons Applied**
Eric’s previous Catalyst projects successfully reached technical completion, but adoption required a stronger link between real-world users and product design. This project intentionally resolves that gap: pilot farmers are included from the outset, and Edward’s experience in commercialisation and communication ensures the project is positioned for real-world uptake—not just technical readiness.

This ensures the protocol is not only functional, but usable and desirable by the community it intends to serve."

019ab910-c6ea-7cdd-bc65-935de085c5b2,Midnight University Alliance: Compact DApps Initiative,60000,Erick Valadez,"- 1.- Erick Valadez — Project Lead / Academic Coordinator

X: [https://x\.com/FilozoFlow](https://x.com/FilozoFlow)

Role in the Project:

Overall responsibility for project execution.

Direct coordination with the 6 participating universities.

Design and delivery of the Midnight and Compact DApps workshops.

Management of logistics, scheduling, materials, and institutional communication.

Student follow-up and formation of the 3 student teams.

I have extensive experience collaborating with Mexican universities, leading educational activities related to Cardano, and building community across the country. I played a key role in Azteca 2025 by establishing connections with participating universities, and I have also collaborated with the LATAM Cardano Community in previous funded proposals. As a Cardano Ambassador in Mexico, I have led workshops, lectures, and academic activities focused on blockchain, contributing to the growth of Cardano’s presence in the region.



- 2.- University Liaison Coordinator

(Each collaboration agreement will designate an official liaison for the corresponding institution. Internal university profiles are not published for confidentiality reasons.)

Role in the Project:

Facilitate access to facilities, classrooms, and technical equipment.

Coordinate the participation of students and faculty in the workshops.

Monitor attendance and support the creation of university communities.

Why this role is essential:

These institutional liaisons ensure proper logistical execution and academic engagement within each university, guaranteeing that activities run smoothly and that the program integrates effectively into each institution’s environment.



- 3.- Midnight Technical Advisor (External Collaborator)

Role in the Project:

Provide technical support during the practical segments of the workshops.

Guide the 3 student teams in structuring their initial Compact DApp prototypes.

Conduct technical reviews of exercises, designs, and early-stage proposals.

Why this role is essential:

This advisor provides the technical expertise required to ensure that students correctly understand Midnight’s architecture and are able to develop functional prototypes. Their support strengthens the quality of the learning experience and increases the likelihood of successful technical outcomes.



- 4.- Audiovisual Production Specialist (Freelance)

Role in the Project:

Visual documentation of workshops, interviews, and key activities.

Editing of the final video required by Project Catalyst.

Organization and storage of all audiovisual evidence for the final report.

Why this role is essential:

Catalyst requires visual evidence and the production of a final results video. This role guarantees professional-quality content and ensures full compliance with reporting requirements.



To further strengthen the project, the possible incorporation of the following roles is considered:

- Logistics Assistant to support schedule management and transportation.
- Second Technical Facilitator, in case of high demand during practical sessions.



These positions will only be activated if the operational workload exceeds initial expectations. They do not affect the feasibility of the project, as all essential roles are already covered.



Why This Team Can Execute the Project Successfully

- Direct experience working with Mexican universities.
- Institutional partners already confirmed.
- Expertise in Cardano, Midnight, and academic training.
- Strong capacity for coordination, documentation, teaching, and student follow-up.
- A structured, measurable approach grounded in verified prior collaborations.



This team has the knowledge, partnerships, and experience required to deliver a solid, responsible project with real impact on the Cardano ecosystem."

The roles are clearly separated so Catalyst can see exactly who builds the project, who validates the architecture, and who ensures delivery.



TxPipe – Technical Oversight & Architecture Validation



TxPipe participates as an external technical reviewer. Their role is limited to architecture validation, structural review of smart contracts, and best-practice guidance for Cardano development. They confirm correctness, security alignment, and design quality before milestones are submitted.

TxPipe does not deliver funded development work, which keeps us aligned with both Catalyst rules and TxPipe’s own policies. Their involvement reduces technical risk and ensures the project follows high engineering standards.



Core Development – Internal + Contracted Engineers



All milestone deliverables -smart contracts, testnet deployments, wallet backend, ZK demo, storage integration, and the transparency dashboard- are implemented by our internal effort supported by contracted Cardano engineers.

This approach gives us full development control, ensures production happens as required by Catalyst, and allows us to scale the team efficiently as milestones progress. Contracted developers have direct experience with Aiken/Plutus, backend APIs, ZK workflows, and decentralized storage integrations.



Diesel – Founder, Product Lead & Operations



I lead the entire project: product direction, milestone planning, execution, coordination with contractors, documentation, and delivery. My background includes performance-driven online marketing both as a private contractor and within Esbjerg municipality. I know how to run growth-focused digital projects, build momentum, and attract users at scale. I manage communication with all technical partners and ensure every milestone is delivered with clear evidence and on schedule.



LATAM Outreach Lead – Influencer Network & User Growth



My wife supports regional expansion, influencer relations, and community building across Brazil and LATAM. She has professional experience in the Brazilian influencer scene and maintains direct contact with high-reach creators. LATAM is one of the strongest early markets for this project, and her network gives us immediate access to real adoption channels once Project 1 is completed and the MVP enters user-facing stages.



Future Scaling & Governance



Upon successful delivery of Project 1 and the MVP, we will expand into a dedicated structure with additional engineering, CTO-level leadership, and marketing roles. We are already planning office facilities in São Paulo to support long-term growth and LATAM-based operations."

**Oliver Naegele** – Project Lead: Oliver is the CEO of Blockchain Helix and will act as the overall project leader. He has over 20 years of experience in IT and is a recognized blockchain pioneer in Germany (serving on the board of Blockchain Association Germany and the European Public Network). Oliver led the development of the CBMT wallet and infrastructure, positioning him uniquely to drive this integration. He will oversee the project’s technical strategy and stakeholder engagement with the banking consortium.

**Sandra Janicijevic**– Project Manager: Sandra is an experienced project manager with a background in fintech implementations. She will handle day-to-day project coordination, timeline management, and communications. Sandra’s role includes ensuring milestones are met, quality control of project outputs, and serving as liaison between the development team, Catalyst, and our consortium partners. Her experience managing compliance-focused projects will help in aligning deliverables with the banks’ processes.

**Ansik Mahapatra** – Blockchain Developer: Ansik is a senior blockchain developer specializing in Ethereum and Solidity smart contract development. He will focus on writing and testing the smart contracts on Milkomeda (CBMT token contract, access control logic, etc.). Ansik has previously worked on enterprise Ethereum projects and is well-versed in security best practices for smart contracts. He will also set up the integration of Cardano’s sidechain with any off-chain components required. Tech lead of the CBMT Wallet.

**Michael B\.** – Blockchain Developer: Michael is a full-stack blockchain engineer with knowledge of Cardano and EVM interoperability. He will work alongside Ansik on developing the bridging logic and any necessary scripts or tooling (for example, he might develop the admin interface for banks and handle integration with existing CBMT systems). Michael’s experience includes working on cross-chain solutions and testing frameworks, which will be invaluable for ensuring our integration is robust.

**Additional Developers** – We have three more software engineers on the team who will contribute to various aspects: one will focus on infrastructure and DevOps (setting up nodes, deployment pipelines, ensuring the Milkomeda environment runs smoothly, handling things like testnet/mainnet deployments); another will assist with testing and QA, writing unit tests, and automating test scenarios; the third will support backend integration, possibly working on any API or database needs for the project (for example, if we maintain a whitelist database or a monitoring dashboard). These developers have backgrounds in blockchain and cloud services, and will be brought in as needed to meet development targets and ensure quality.

**Team’s Strengths** Our team combines deep technical skill in blockchain (especially Ethereum-based tech) with direct domain experience in the CBMT project. We already speak the language of both the Cardano ecosystem and the banking consortium. This allows us to efficiently bridge requirements and implement solutions that satisfy all stakeholders. The team’s composition covers all necessary roles – leadership, project management, development, testing, and deployment. We also have access to advisors from the CBMT consortium (e.g., a compliance expert or a banking IT architect) whom we can consult if specialized input is needed, although they are not listed as core team members. With this team, we are confident in delivering the project with high accountability: each member has a clear role, and collectively we have delivered similar complex projects in the past."

It delivers real adoption for a multi-billion-dollar sector, turning Cardano into the backbone of Argentina’s next agricultural leap.

Backed by **@ASI\_Alliance, @SingularityNET, @Fetch\_ai, @CUDOS\_**, and reinforced locally with TxPipe’s **@txpipe\_tools** PoK-solid engineering, we combine AI automation, MeTTa cognitive reasoning, decentralized compute, and Cardano-native infra into one powerful RWA engine.

Guillermo Lucero @**LuceroFunes\_G** and Leandro Gavidia **@androgavidia** with 30+ years put together of multichain delivery, leads execution brings hardcore AI-blockchain dev skills; and Inés Gaviña **@inegava1** ensures crystal-clear narrative alignment to keep devs, cooperatives, and partners fully synced.

Argentina a system built for the campo, not for PowerPoints — a platform cooperatives and SMEs can actually use.

Jorge Luis Borges’s vision from El Aleph:

- “Vi el Aleph… el lugar donde están, sin confundirse, todos los lugares del orbe.”
- _“I saw the Aleph… the place where all the places of the world are, without being confused\.”_

In the same spirit, blockchain and AI let us see — and verify — every step of the supply chain without confusion: every grain batch, every animal, every certificate, every transaction, all coexisting in a single trustworthy ledger.

This project captures that Aleph-like clarity; A decentralized point where all agricultural events become transparent, auditable, interoperable, and automated by AI. That’s the paradigm shift — bringing the entire agro-industry into a future where information is complete, visible, and incorruptible.

With strong alliances, local adoption partners, and a dev team que la tiene clara, this MVP is designed to scale across Argentina and LATAM. We are ready to ship, ready to onboard cooperatives, and ready to plant Cardano as the core infrastructure of the region’s agri-economy.

- Real assets, real producers, real settlement, real AI — Cardano powering the next agricultural revolution in our country.

Founder of the Romanian Cyber Space Initiative (ROCSI) and long-time independent builder with over 20 years of experience in software, digital products, and remote collaborations. Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate, actively involved in the ecosystem as a Web3 / blockchain advisor and decentralized governance enthusiast.



Mihai is the designer and main developer of the existing civic platform that powers this proposal, responsible for the frontend (TypeScript/React), the Supabase/Postgres backend, API integrations, and deployment on Google Cloud. He also manages Linux servers, SSL/DNS configuration, and continuous delivery scripts for multiple production services.



**His background includes:**



- Software quality assurance and solution architecture for commercial software products, with strong focus on reliability and usability.
- WordPress and web application development, including integrating payment, authentication and marketing systems.
- Advisory roles in blockchain / AI projects (e.g., VeterinaryDAO board of advisors, Web3 marketing advisor for several SingularityNET ecosystem projects), which gives him practical experience at the intersection of decentralized tech, token ecosystems and community building.



**Within this project, Mihai will act as:**



- Product & Technical Lead – responsible for the overall architecture of the Civic Sentiment Index, the Demeter/Cardano integration, and the evolution of the existing civic platform to support on-chain publishing.
- Backend & Infrastructure Engineer – implementing the aggregation jobs, transaction construction and submission flows, monitoring, and security/privacy safeguards.
- Project Manager & Liaison – coordinating with Demeter, local civic partners and external testers, and delivering all milestones and reports to Catalyst.



**Supporting roles**



The project will also rely on a small set of supporting contributors engaged on a part-time or contract basis:



- Frontend / UX collaborator – assists with the Civic Sentiment Explorer UI, charts and mainnet/testnet views, working under Mihai’s technical direction.
- Data protection / legal advisor (external) – consulted as needed to review the aggregation and anonymisation approach, ensuring that on-chain data remains compliant with privacy requirements for civic deployments.
- Civic pilot partners – municipal or NGO partners who help test the prototype in real-world workflows and provide structured feedback; they are not funded team members but are important for validating the solution.



Overall, the project is deliberately scoped so that a single experienced lead can deliver the core engineering work, while targeted specialist input is brought in only where it adds clear value (UX polish, privacy review, and domain validation)."

I am a blockchain and AI developer with extensive experience in decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and compliance-focused blockchain systems. My professional journey began in the **Cardano ecosystem**, where I have been active since 2023. During this time, I gained hands-on experience with **Plutus smart contracts**, testnet deployment, and helping teams deploy contracts on-chain. I have designed and implemented scalable identity tooling, privacy-preserving workflows, and on-chain verification systems, giving me a strong understanding of Cardano’s technical infrastructure and what it takes to build robust, reusable solutions.



I have also worked with Ontology Network as the Africa Community Lead, where I contributed to DID and identity solutions, including **AI DID**, **IM DID secure messaging**, and identity-integrated Web3 applications. I delivered a funded Ontology project building an identity layer for an NFT-based platform, integrating **DID-based verification** into digital collectibles and user profiles. While Ontology strengthened my practical DID expertise, my focus for this project is on applying **Cardano-native smart contracts and identity systems** to build a reusable, privacy-preserving KYC-as-a-Service marketplace.



**For this project, I will lead:**



* Smart contract design and development for the KYC marketplace on Cardano

* Backend logic, DID/VC workflows, and selective disclosure mechanisms

* Zero-knowledge–friendly architecture and validator logic

* Product design, milestone planning, and system architecture

* Developer documentation, reports, and integration guides

* Oversight of financial accountability and transparent fund management



I bring a unique combination of **Cardano smart contract expertise, DID and VC experience, and real-world project delivery**, ensuring the marketplace is technically sound, privacy-preserving, and ready for adoption by institutions and developers.

019ab7e6-cb5d-7773-922d-42c34d02e9a4,Powering a Community Cooperative using Cardano by selfdriven,200000,Mark Byers,"**The selfdriven Foundation team has been working for more than five years at the intersection of community governance, decentralised identity, and practical real-world blockchain adoption. We specialise in building systems that make complex Web3 tooling usable by everyday people, with a strong focus on education, cooperatives, and inclusive economic participation.**



This proposal is led by a multidisciplinary team combining:

- Smart contract engineers experienced in Cardano development

- UX and product designers specialising in human-centred design for non-technical users

- Identity and governance specialists with applied SSI and cooperative governance experience

- Cooperative advisors and community facilitators supporting real-world organisational change



The team already has production deployments of organisational operating systems across education, insurance, health, and community development — giving us direct experience delivering end-to-end systems, not just proof-of-concepts.



We are confident executing this proposal because we have:

- a proven model for translating real-world organisational processes into digital and on-chain flows

- experience engaging non-technical participants and scaffolding change management

- the entire required skillset in-house, removing dependency risk on external contractors



The team is strengthened by strategic collaboration with members of The Beyonders Collective, who will operate as the live pilot partner. Their direct participation ensures that every design and technical decision is grounded in real cooperative needs, not abstract assumptions.



The cultural philosophy of the team is simple:



If everyday communities cannot use it — it is not adoption.



Our experience, track record, and community-first approach position us to deliver a reliable, repeatable, and community-beneficial operating model for cooperatives on Cardano, and to do so in a way that can be scaled and replicated globally.

I have been working in the ecosystem since 2021 as a Community Reviewer, from fund 5 until fund 14

Since the role was created, I have also been working as a moderator (L2) and milestone reviewer for funded projects. My dedication to Project Catalyst is solid and constant, allowing me to gain more and more space within the community and being constantly requested for new translation projects.

In addition to translating for LATAM over the years, I have other experiences such as transcribing governance meeting minutes, performing the Proof of Life (PoL) function, and participating in Brazilian meetings on CIP 1694.

I have advanced English proficiency, having graduated from the Wizard and Cultura Inglês schools, where I have intermediate and advanced level courses (the certificates are on my LinkedIn).

Beyond my work in the community, a little about myself: I'm 26 years old, a Brazilian who loves to travel and explore new cultures. I also love writing, recording videos, and editing. I'm interested in the complexity of the human mind, which is why I study psychology, but my work is currently entirely dedicated to Cardano.

019ac369-7842-7e6f-bf27-531bf1136093,Anomaly Protocol - The Engine Powering Cardano DeFi,200000,David Parrish,"The project is led by a specialised in-house engineering and research team with deep expertise in deterministic risk architecture, Cardano development, formal modelling, and validator-aligned system design. The team combines mathematical rigour, practical Plutus engineering capability, and extensive experience building reproducible, deterministic state-machine systems suitable for Cardano’s execution model.

David Parrish — Lead Architect &amp; Mathematical Designer

David is the creator and principal architect behind the deterministic risk engine. His work focuses on:

deterministic state-transition modelling

solvency and margin invariants

collateral weighting and stress-response logic

volatility and risk-sensitivity structures

formal design of validator-enforceable financial rules

He is responsible for the system’s mathematical foundations, deterministic modelling approach, and overall architectural integrity.

The MVP is built directly on this proprietary framework, which has already undergone comprehensive and robust independent feasibility and validation by Jonathan Rodriguez and Mladen Lamesevic Founders of No Witness Labs, acclaimed recognised Cardano engineers.

Internal Engineering Team — Deterministic Systems &amp; Plutus Development

The internal engineering team brings strong competency across:

Plutus V2/V3 smart-contract development

deterministic off-chain simulation engineering

eUTxO-based state-machine design

TypeScript transaction-construction flows

validator feasibility modelling

reproducible testing frameworks

integration-schema and schema-driven design

The team has prior experience working with complex validator logic, cost-model boundaries, and deterministic execution constraints, enabling them to deliver the full MVP in-house without external engineering dependencies.

Independent Feasibility &amp; Technical Validation (Completed Pre-Proposal)

A complete architectural feasibility review and validator-level assessment has already been performed externally by highly respected Cardano engineers. This independent review confirmed:

validator-level feasibility of the core design

script-size and cost-model compatibility

deterministic execution alignment

reference-input and datum structure suitability

validity of the state-transition and solvency model

This prior validation gives the project a high degree of confidence and demonstrates that the architecture is technically sound before Catalyst resources are used.

Combined Capability

Collectively, the in-house team provides expertise in:

deterministic financial modelling

risk-engine architecture

simulation design and reproducibility

Plutus validator implementation

on-chain/off-chain integration pathways

formal state-machine design

testing and verification

documentation and technical writing

This blend of mathematical leadership and internal engineering capability—combined with independent feasibility confirmation already completed—creates a strong and credible delivery profile for the deterministic risk engine MVP. The project enters Catalyst with a validated design, a realistic scope, and a highly capable internal team ready to execute the full development plan."

What brings us together is a shared purpose: to bridge the world of science with the possibilities of Cardano. Between us, we’ve got the science, the experience, the creative firepower — and the track record to back it up.

1. Leonardo Dandeu – Project Lead &amp; Educational Lead

Leonardo is a licensed hematologist and breast cancer researcher with hands-on clinical and academic experience across Latin America. He’s currently a PhD fellow at CONICET — Argentina’s national science council — and lead author of a published study on breast cancer (PubMed [https://pubmed\.ncbi\.nlm\.nih\.gov/39927763/\)\.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39927763/).)

But he’s not just about lab coats and research papers. Leo has also been exploring the frontier between science and blockchain. He’s part of the DeSci Quark alumni network, has helped test their early educational programs, and won a Cardano Ideathon in 2024 with a proposal on blockchain for healthcare.

In this project, he’s the heart of the mission — guiding the vision, crafting the educational sessions, and connecting directly with oncology experts in the field.

019ac173-4299-7603-b585-c0e3083361f4,Seasons of Collaboration: Funding the ODIN Initiative,60000,ODIN Community,"ODIN has created significant value in the broader web3 ecosystem by fostering human connection, enabling decentralized collaboration, and promoting effective governance principles. Its origins trace back to Catalyst-funded book clubs, which laid foundational ideas. Early collaborations among key organizations like Gimbalabs, Cardano4Climate, and WADA led to the birth of both Andamio and ODIN. ODIN's study and application of S3 governance principles have directly influenced the organizational structures and decision-making processes of entities such as Gimbalabs, Andamio, and multiple Intersect committees and the Intersect Steering Committee, and Constitutional Governance Workstreams.

ODIN serves as a training and proving ground for working in a decentralized manner, where results are the clearest indicator of success. The network is also actively developing methods for direct and fair compensation for contributors, connecting purpose, meaning, and collaboration with the creation of individual value within the Cardano ecosystem and beyond.

ODIN's team makes space for people dedicated to decentralized work. We have defined community roles including our Cultivator (a role facilitating weekly efforts, meetings and coordination) and Harvester (a role focused on gathering the results and enabling reflection and evolution). We will continue defining new roles as needed. Our individuals include:

**Newman Lanier** (see: [https://github\.com/Newman5\)](https://github.com/Newman5)) - background in educational technology and knowledge management, focused on healthy mechanisms of enabling loose coherence between autonomous individuals and groups, so their efforts can be mutually impactful while blending the boundaries and breaking down silos.

019ac366-bc8b-7e0f-866f-a402da215e40,From Labs to BIOHUB – Building Science on Cardano,50000,"Dandeu Leonardo, PhD","We’re a small team — but mighty where it counts. What brings us together is a shared purpose: to bridge the world of science with the possibilities of Cardano. Between us, we’ve got the science, the experience, the creative firepower — and the track record to back it up.

**1\. Leonardo Dandeu – Project Lead &amp; Educational Lead**

LinkedIn [https://www\.linkedin\.com/in/leonardo\-dandeu\-15ab33aa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-dandeu-15ab33aa/) | Research Profile [https://bicyt\.conicet\.gov\.ar/fichas/p/leonardo\-nestor\-ruben\-dandeu](https://bicyt.conicet.gov.ar/fichas/p/leonardo-nestor-ruben-dandeu)

Leonardo is a licensed hematologist and breast cancer researcher with hands-on clinical and academic experience across Latin America. He’s currently a PhD fellow at CONICET — Argentina’s national science council — and lead author of a published study on breast cancer (PubMed [https://pubmed\.ncbi\.nlm\.nih\.gov/39927763/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39927763/)).

But he’s not just about lab coats and research papers. Leo has also been exploring the frontier between science and blockchain. He’s part of the DeSci Quark alumni network, has helped test their early educational programs, and won a Cardano Ideathon in 2024 with a proposal on blockchain for healthcare.

For this BioHub, he’s leading the vision — designing learning experiences, guiding scientific outreach, and keeping our work grounded in the realities of research across the region.



**2\. Nerina Ermacora – Project Coordinator &amp; Media/Design Lead**

LinkedIn [https://www\.linkedin\.com/in/nerina\-ermacora/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerina-ermacora/)

Nerina brings a rare mix of precision, creativity, and people skills. She’s a specialist in client management and institutional relations — and also a talented visual designer. She was co‑proposer of the successfully completed DeSci Quark project ([https://desciquark\.com/en/](https://desciquark.com/en/) )(Catalyst F13, ID 1300094), where she managed overall coordination, produced multimedia content (interviews, editing, visual design), and built strong bridges with researchers and students.

In this BioHub, she’s steering day-to-day operations, producing all visual and video content, and leading communications with participants and the broader scientific community.

Together, we bring:

✔ Real-world scientific knowledge (cancer, hematology, Latin American healthcare)

✔ Hands-on experience with blockchain, Web3, and the Cardano ecosystem

✔ Proven project delivery — education, design, and community building



_And above all — we care about doing it with respect, clarity, and openness\. That’s what makes this team ready to build the first BioHub on Cardano\._"

The manufacturing teams will be confirmed and order placed within the first 3 months

Chronoracle will also contact Cardano related Hubs and marketing teams to confirm where to send the samples.

Chronoracle has a binding agreement to uphold the integrity of the Cardano community, its Brand and Image

Chronoracle is also under additional oversight due to policy and regulation given the securities licensing of the Founder. IE there will not likely ever be a token launch.

Any ICO type of investment, for example, is many times prohibited or regulated selling for a certain period of time...Sales and other outside business related ventures for Chronoracle are monitored."

019ac18f-dd4e-7089-833a-be61742923c6,Sundial’s Bitcoin-Aware Plutus Smart Contracts,700000,Sheldon Hunt,"This proposal is led by Sundial, with selective involvement from experienced Cardano ecosystem contributors as needed. Sundial delivers the core research, cross-chain architectural work, Bitcoin primitive integration, Plutus execution-layer extensions, prototype development, and mainnet deployment.



Some protocol-specific integration tasks may be subcontracted to trusted Cardano developers once pilot protocols are chosen in Milestone 1.



Sundial has extensive experience in UTxO architecture, L2 rollup design, Bitcoin interoperability, and deterministic smart contract systems. This provides the required foundation to safely extend Plutus applications with authenticated Bitcoin state.



**Sundial**

Role: Lead Applicant, Research, Engineering & Delivery



- Acts as the Catalyst proposal owner, responsible for milestone delivery, reporting, and cross-team coordination.
- Leads institutional interviews and requirements mapping with BTC holders and existing Sundial partners.
- Owns the cross-chain systems architecture, defining how authenticated Bitcoin events map into Sundial’s execution layer and Plutus semantics.
- Implements the Bitcoin primitive integration, including header-chain processing, UTxO verification, Taproot condition evaluation, and the Bitcoin-state correctness pipeline.
- Designs and validates the Bitcoin-aware Plutus data interface, ensuring deterministic behavior and compatibility with existing Plutus execution expectations.
- Oversees pilot protocol integrations, guiding partner teams through adoption of the new interface.
- Manages mainnet deployment, technical documentation, release preparation, and ecosystem communication.
- Coordinates technical feedback cycles with Cardano developers, institutional partners, and auditors.



Team Lead: Sheldon Hunt

Contributors: Sundial’s core architecture, engineering, and product teams.



**Plutus Contributors \(Consultative Role During Milestone 2\)**

During Milestone 2, the project will include consultations with members of the Plutus core development community:



- Review the interface design for conceptual alignment with future Plutus directions.
- Offer informal design critiques to ensure Bitcoin events integrate cleanly into the existing and future functional execution model.



These contributors are not a dependency for delivery; rather, they serve as an expert sounding board to ensure the interface is future-proof and ecosystem-aligned.



**External Contributors \(Contracted as Needed\)**

Once the two pilot Cardano DeFi protocols are selected, certain tasks may be subcontracted to ecosystem developers already familiar with those protocols:



- pilot integration wiring,
- protocol adapter creation,
- off-chain indexing or transaction-building support.



Contracted contributors will be chosen for their familiarity with the specific DeFi architectures involved, ensuring efficient and reliable execution without unnecessary onboarding overhead.



No additional vendors or external systems are required. Sundial maintains full control over design, implementation, testing, and deployment."
019abdda-f8ed-7ec6-83a7-6c0a26098880,Innovation: First End-to-End Peer Review Platform on Cardano,200000,"Agnostica, Ltd.","Agnostica brings a cross-functional team with deep expertise in blockchain product development, academic research, and user-centered design. This project is led by Alex James, founder of Agnostica—a research consultancy focused on bridging scholarly insight with emerging blockchain applications. Alex is a seasoned product manager with a proven track record delivering both decentralized and SaaS-based tools across multiple ecosystems.



DeFi Product Leadership: Alex has led product development for Ultra Capital, a non-custodial DeFi yield token frontend built on Stellar, offering users simple access to tokenized yield strategies. He also managed the product roadmap for USDC Swap, a cross-chain stablecoin swap platform. In both cases, Alex directed efforts across smart contract integration, user experience, and go-to-market readiness. These projects required secure backend infrastructure, scalable architecture, and thoughtful onboarding flows for both crypto-native and general users.



SaaS and UX at Scale: As a Product Manager with Raw.bot, Alex oversaw development of popular Slack-based productivity apps—including BirthdayBot and TimeBot—now used by tens of thousands of teams, with hundreds of thousands of users ldwide. These apps are recognized for their intuitive UX, enterprise-grade reliability, and seamless integration into complex workplace environments.



Development Capacity On Standby: Drawing from this track record, Alex will bring the same vetted developers and designers from these prior projects into this Cardano initiative. These collaborators include full-stack engineers familiar with blockchain architectures (including Cardano’s Plutus/Haskell tooling), front-end dApp specialists, and experienced designers with a focus on intuitive, low-friction UX. With funding in place, this team is prepared to begin MVP development immediately.



Academic and Research Leadership:

Dr. Robert Danielson (Co-Founder, Research Lead) is a PhD researcher with over a decade of academic experience. He has authored 25+ peer-reviewed publications, managed nearly $2M in research funding, and served on multiple editorial boards. He brings firsthand understanding of peer review pain points and scholarly infrastructure needs. In this project, Robert leads content design, academic standards integration (ORCID, DOI, etc.), and user validation through outreach to academic beta testers. His grant experience ensures responsible fund use and reporting.



In short, Agnostica combines technical readiness, academic insight, and delivery experience. We have the team, infrastructure, and research foundation to execute a usable, testnet-deployed MVP that addresses real problems in academic publishing—and to do so with quality, speed, and community alignment."

019ab514-406f-7f72-acb1-df5504892c6c,sovereigns.institute,54321,Self Sovereign,"# Contributor Approach
Catalyst's historical funding delays created situations where promised contributor engagement could not be honored, damaging relationships despite good intentions. 



Learning from this, this proposer commits to onboarding computational commons contributors—workshop facilitators, schema architects, cultural consultants building on delegated representatives from over fifty-one countries, translators emphasizing subject-object-verb structures across eight languages, disaster specialists, rural revitalization experts, legal advisors across UK, Swiss, and Japanese contexts, technical writers, community coordinators, partnership liaisons, and video producers—only after funding receipt and stable currency conversion ensuring reliable compensation.



This milestone-threshold approach protects both contributor relationships and project reputation. Should early milestones not achieve objectives as community determines, funding firewall ensures remaining allocations stay secure rather than creating cascading failures. Given eight years visible participation, reputation preservation through honest execution carries paramount importance. 



The approach provides latitude for adapting to emergent realities while maintaining accountability through deliverable-based evaluation, with transparent communication about challenges and good-faith efforts toward objectives."

Dr. Danielson is an educational psychologist with extensive experience in how people overcome misconceptions. He has spent over a decade researching conceptual change and refutational learning methods, authoring more than 25 peer-reviewed publications and securing nearly $2 million in competitive research funding (including grants from the NSF and NIH). One of his recent works was a meta-study on refutational approaches – the very strategy this project will use – and he is contributing a chapter on teaching for conceptual change in an upcoming Oxford educational psychology handbook. In short, Robert’s academic rigor and specialty in correcting false beliefs will ensure our messaging is evidence-based and effective at helping people “unlearn” Cardano myths. He will lead the research-driven design of the content so that each video short is not only factually accurate but also psychologically tuned to change minds.



Alex James, MA – Managing Director, Agnostica; Technical Program Manager. Alex has led end-to-end delivery of products and research programs for startups, public sector, and large enterprises—owning roadmaps, budgets, vendor coordination, and risk/compliance with his extensive experience in technology product management and content development, strengthens our project's implementation side. His track record of driving successful technology adoption and value-realization projects lends credibility to our capability to deliver. His graduate-level training in qualitative research methodologies further enhances our research capacity.



Agnostica, Ltd. – Research & Innovation Consultancy (Team Track Record). Dr. Danielson and Mr. James have joined forces under Agnostica, their research and innovation consultancy, which has a strong track record in blockchain communication and peer-reviewed research. In 2025, they spearheaded a public science communication initiative on decentralized knowledge, co-authoring an industry research report on blockchain-based peer review and publishing. That project was all about bridging complex research into accessible insights for the community – and they delivered a comprehensive report openly to Cardano members, showcasing their commitment to open knowledge and Cardano’s values. The same combination of academic rigor and creative flair that drove that success will be applied to Debunking Cardano Myths. Both team members are long-time Cardano community members, and together they bring a “secret sauce” of credibility and creativity: an expert who understands the science of learning, and a producer who understands the art of storytelling. This is not theory for them – it’s a continuation of work they’ve already been doing to make blockchain concepts understandable and engaging to broad audiences."

019ab50d-aaa2-7b25-8edb-cd4d6eb604c8,build.foundation,123456,Self Sovereign,"# Contributor Approach
Catalyst's historical funding delays created situations where promised contributor engagement could not be honored, damaging relationships despite good intentions.

Learning from this, this proposer commits to onboarding computational commons contributors—workshop facilitators, schema architects, cultural consultants building on delegated representatives from over fifty-one countries, translators emphasizing subject-object-verb structures across eight languages, disaster specialists, rural revitalization experts, legal advisors across UK, Swiss, and Japanese contexts, technical writers, community coordinators, partnership liaisons, and video producers—only after funding receipt and stable currency conversion ensuring reliable compensation.

This milestone-threshold approach protects both contributor relationships and project reputation. Should early milestones not achieve objectives as community determines, funding firewall ensures remaining allocations stay secure rather than creating cascading failures. Given eight years visible participation, reputation preservation through honest execution carries paramount importance.

The approach provides latitude for adapting to emergent realities while maintaining accountability through deliverable-based evaluation, with transparent communication about challenges and good-faith efforts toward objectives."
