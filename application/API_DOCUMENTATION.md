# Proposal REST API Documentation

## Overview
The Proposal API uses Laravel API Resources with Spatie Query Builder to provide powerful filtering, sorting, and relationship includes.

## API Versioning
The API is versioned using URL prefixes. The current version is `v1`.

### Versioning Strategy
- **v1 (Current):** Full-featured REST API with Spatie Query Builder
- **Legacy (Unversioned):** Basic endpoints maintained for backward compatibility
- **Future versions (v2, v3, etc.):** Will be added as needed without breaking existing versions

### Migration Recommendations
- **New integrations:** Use the versioned API (`/api/v1/proposals`)
- **Existing integrations:** Legacy endpoints (`/api/proposals`) will continue to work
- **Best practice:** Gradually migrate to versioned endpoints for future-proofing

## Base URLs
**Versioned API (Recommended):**
```
/api/v1/proposals
```

**Legacy API (Unversioned - for backward compatibility):**
```
/api/proposals
```

## Endpoints

### 1. List Proposals
**GET** `/api/v1/proposals`

Returns a paginated list of proposals with optional filtering, sorting, and includes.

> **Legacy:** `GET /api/proposals` (unversioned endpoint still available for backward compatibility)

#### Query Parameters

##### Filtering
- `filter[id]=123` - Exact match by ID
- `filter[title]=search term` - Partial match by title
- `filter[status]=active` - Exact match by status
- `filter[type]=proposal` - Exact match by type
- `filter[category]=development` - Exact match by category
- `filter[campaign_id]=456` - Exact match by campaign ID
- `filter[fund_id]=789` - Exact match by fund ID
- `filter[funded]=1` - Filter only funded proposals
- `filter[amount_min]=1000` - Minimum amount requested
- `filter[amount_max]=50000` - Maximum amount requested

##### Sorting
- `sort=title` - Sort by title (ascending)
- `sort=-created_at` - Sort by created date (descending)
- `sort=amount_requested` - Sort by amount requested
- `sort=-yes_votes_count` - Sort by votes (descending)

Available sort fields:
- `title`
- `status`
- `amount_requested`
- `amount_received`
- `yes_votes_count`
- `no_votes_count`
- `funded_at`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

##### Includes (Relationships)
- `include=campaign` - Include campaign relationship
- `include=user` - Include user relationship
- `include=fund` - Include fund relationship
- `include=campaign,user` - Include multiple relationships

##### Pagination
- `per_page=24` - Items per page (max 60)
- `page=2` - Page number

### 2. Get Single Proposal
**GET** `/api/v1/proposals/{id}`

Returns a single proposal by ID.

> **Legacy:** Individual proposal endpoints are only available in the versioned API.

#### Query Parameters
- `include=campaign,user` - Include relationships

## Example Requests

```

### Complex Query
```
GET /api/v1/proposals?include=campaign,user&filter[funded]=1&filter[amount_min]=1000&sort=-funded_at&per_page=50
```

### Get Single Proposal with Relationships

```

### Legacy Examples (Unversioned)
