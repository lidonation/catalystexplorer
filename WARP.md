## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture (Laravel)

**Core Models**: The platform centers around these key entities:
- `Proposal` - Project Catalyst proposals with funding details
- `Campaign` - Funding campaigns (grouped proposals)  
- `Fund` - Higher-level funding rounds
- `IdeascaleProfile` - Community member profiles
- `Review` - Community reviews of proposals
- `Vote` - Voting records from Jormungandr chain
- `Community` - User groups and organizations

**Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Located in `app/DataTransferObjects/`, these define structured data for API responses and type safety with the frontend.

**API Strategy**: 
- RESTful API with versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- Uses Spatie Query Builder for advanced filtering/sorting
- API Resources for consistent JSON responses
- Legacy unversioned endpoints maintained for backward compatibility

**Search Integration**: Meilisearch powers the search functionality with:
- Custom search indexes for major models
- Scout integration for automatic indexing
- Configurable index management via Artisan commands

**External Data Sources**:
- Cardano blockchain data via CARP (Cardano Application with Real-time Postgres)
- Ideascale API integration for community data
- NMKR integration for NFT functionality

### Frontend Architecture (React + Inertia.js)

**Directory Structure**:
- `resources/js/Components/` - Reusable React components
- `resources/js/pages/` - Page-level components mapped to Laravel routes
- `resources/js/layouts/` - Layout components
- `resources/js/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `resources/js/db/` - IndexedDB integration for offline data

**State Management**: 
- React hooks and context for local state
- IndexedDB (via Dexie) for persistent client-side data
- Inertia.js for server-state synchronization

**UI Framework**:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI components for accessibility
- Nivo for data visualization charts
- Framer Motion for animations

**TypeScript Integration**:
- Laravel TypeScript Transformer generates types from PHP DTOs
- Strict typing throughout React components
- Generated database schema types for IndexedDB

### Database Architecture

**Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with these key patterns:
- Snake_case naming for tables/columns
- UUID primary keys with hash ID casting for public URLs
- Eloquent relationships define all associations
- Migrations with descriptive names and proper down() methods

**Search Database**: Meilisearch indexes:
- `cx_proposals` - Main proposal search
- `cx_communities` - Community search
- `cx_ideascale_profiles` - Profile search
- Custom index configuration per model

**External Database**: CARP connection for Cardano blockchain data access

### Development Patterns

**Code Organization**: Follows Laravel conventions with:
- Controllers use resourceful routes when possible
- Models include DTOs, Policies, and Repositories as required
- Services extracted for complex business logic
- Jobs for background processing

**API Patterns**:
- API Resources transform model data consistently
- Spatie Query Builder enables powerful filtering: `filter[status]=active&sort=-created_at&include=campaign`
- Pagination with configurable per_page (max 60)

**Frontend Patterns**:
- Function components with React Hooks
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Component composition over inheritance
- Consistent error handling and loading states

**Internationalization (i18n)**:
- Full multilingual support with Laravel localization
- Supported languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Amharic, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Swahili
- Frontend language switching via React components with URL routing
- Translation files stored in `application/lang/` directory
- Frontend language configuration in `resources/js/constants/locales.ts`

## Key Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Database: PostgreSQL connection + CARP secondary connection
- Redis: Used for caching, queues, and sessions
- Meilisearch: Search engine configuration
- External APIs: Ideascale, NMKR tokens
- PHP: Version 8.4 with modern array functions (array_any, etc.)

### Docker Services
- `catalystexplorer.com` - Main Laravel application
- `catalystexplorer.pgsql` - PostgreSQL database  
- `catalystexplorer.redis` - Redis cache/queue
- `catalystexplorer.meilisearch` - Search engine
- `catalystexplorer.allure` - E2E test reporting

### Workflow System
Multi-step user workflows are implemented for:
- Claiming Ideascale profiles
- Creating voter lists with wallet signatures
- Generating NFTs for completed projects
- Service registration

Each workflow uses session state and middleware for step validation.

## Important Development Notes

### Commit Standards
Follow Conventional Commits: `<type>[scope]: <ticket-no> <description>`
Examples: `feat(proposals): ln-1343 added search filtering`, `fix(api): ln-1545 resolved pagination bug`

### Testing Strategy
- **Pest (PHP)**: Unit/feature tests with architecture testing
- **Playwright (E2E)**: Full browser automation with Allure reporting
- Tests run in isolated Docker environment with test database

### Code Style
- **PHP**: Laravel Pint for formatting, follows PSR-12 (running on PHP 8.4)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier with import organization
- **Database**: Snake_case, explicit foreign keys, proper indexes

### Search Best Practices
- Use `make create-index` before `make import-index` for new models
- Search indexes require model configuration in `MODELS` variable in Makefile
- Test search functionality after index changes

### Performance Considerations  
- Eager loading relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Meilisearch for fast full-text search
- PostgreSQL query optimization with proper indexing

### Translation Management
- **Adding new languages**: 
  1. Create translation file in `application/lang/{locale}.json`
  2. Add locale to `config/localized-routes.php` supported_locales and locale_details
  3. Update `resources/js/constants/locales.ts` SUPPORTED_LOCALES and LOCALE_MAPPING
  4. Add language option to `resources/js/Components/LangSwitcher.tsx`
- **Translation keys**: Use dot notation for nested translations (e.g., 'workflows.voterList.title')
- **Testing translations**: Use the provided test script to verify integration
- **URL structure**: Localized routes follow pattern `/{locale}/path` (e.g., `/sw/proposals`)

### Redirect-After-Login System
A comprehensive redirect-after-login system has been implemented to ensure users are taken to their intended destination after authentication.

**Backend Components:**
- **CaptureIntendedUrl Middleware**: Captures intended URLs with priority system (query params → current URL → referer)
- **AuthenticatedSessionController**: Enhanced with multi-source redirect validation and fallback hierarchy
- **URL Validation**: Comprehensive security checks prevent redirect loops and malicious redirects
- **Localized Route Support**: Handles internationalized auth routes (`/en/login`, `/es/register`, etc.)

**Frontend Components:**
- **LoginForm Component**: Integrated with backend for seamless redirect handling
- **useIntendedUrl Hook**: Custom React hook for SPA state management with localStorage persistence
- **Multi-auth Support**: Both traditional and wallet-based login methods include redirect logic

**Security Features:**
- Host validation ensures redirects stay within the same domain
- Path filtering blocks auth routes, API endpoints, and admin areas
- Malicious URL prevention with comprehensive validation
- Support for localized routes in validation logic

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Priority order: Form data → Session intended → Referer → Default home
- Automatic cleanup of redirect state after successful authentication
- SPA-friendly with localStorage persistence for complex navigation patterns
- Full integration with both email/password and wallet authentication flows
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and security scenarios
